# Investigate-a-Dataset

# Introduction
This data analysis explores a file containing data for 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. Multiple variables are contained within the dataset, of which most could have been potentially used to explore. From this, 3 key independent variables and one dependent variable have been selected for analysis. The three independent variables were Age, Gender & Neighborhood. The dependent variable chosen being whether a patient turns up for their medical appointment or not. These three independent variables were ultimately selected because they would be insightful for determining whether or not patients show up at their medical appointments. This investigation from the data provided helps increase our perception of whether patients will appear for their medical appointments in the future in the areas provided. 

4 research questions were gathered and explored for this project:

1. Can knowing a patient's gender help us to determine whether they will show up for their scheduled appointment? 
2. Can knowing a patient's age help us to determine whether they will show up for their scheduled appointment? 
3. Can knowing the neighborhood that a patient resides help us to determine whether they will show up for their scheduled appointment?  
4. Can knowing the patientâ€™s illness help us determine whether they will show up for their scheduled appointment?
